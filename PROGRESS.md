# Arcturus progress

A living log of where the project stands, maintained as work proceeds. The
authoritative plan is `docs/00-roadmap.md` (milestones B0 to B8); this file
tracks status against it and records decisions made during implementation.

Last updated: 2026-06-27.

## Status at a glance

| Milestone | Description | Status |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| B0 | Project scaffold and VS Code extension | done |
| B1 | Lexer and parser producing an AST, with unit tests | done |
| B2 | Semantic analysis and the world-model IR | done |
| B3 | Z-machine backend MVP (smallest valid story file) | done |
| B4 | Cosmos compiled: parser, turn loop, standard verbs | in progress |
| B5 | Size pass (dead-code elimination, abbreviations, codegen) | pending |
| B6 | Feature-complete for a real game | pending |
| B7 | Graphics via `arc_image` | pending |
| B8 | Write the target game in Arcturus | pending |

Not production-ready: the compiler generates valid z5 story files for the
language subset built so far, but the runtime (parser, turn loop, verbs) is not
in place yet, so it cannot compile a playable game.

## Toolchain

- Python 3.14.6 is the machine default (`python3`); the compiler targets 3.11+.
- Tests run with `python3 -m pytest` (pytest 9.1.1, a dev-only dependency). The
  compiler itself stays standard-library only.
- Frotz is installed for verifying built story files from B3 onward.

## Done

### B0: scaffold and VS Code extension

- Git initialized; the specs committed first.
- Repository layout, `pyproject.toml` (3.11+, zero runtime deps, pytest
  dev-only), `LICENSE` (MIT), `.gitignore`.
- The two reference games extracted verbatim into `examples/` (verified by diff
  against docs/01 sections 17 and 18).
- VS Code extension under `editors/vscode/`: TextMate grammar and language
  configuration, packaged as an installable `.vsix` (built by
  `tools/build_vsix.py`), covering `.storyarc`, `.prelude`, and `.granule`.

### B1: lexer, parser, AST

- `arcturus/` package: `lexer` (indentation-significant tokenizer, multi-line
  strings with whitespace collapse and `${...}` interpolation, UUID literals),
  `ast`, `parser` (recursive descent plus precedence climbing), `astdump`, and
  the `arcc` CLI.
- Done-test green: both example sources parse cleanly.
- `is`-as-property-test versus `is`-as-equality is deliberately left to B2.

### B2: semantic analysis and the world-model IR

- `arcturus/` gains `prelude` (the standard Cosmos environment as data,
  injected into the analyzer so nothing about Cosmos is hardcoded; it will be
  replaced by compiling real `.prelude` source in B4), `worldmodel` (the IR),
  `sema` (the analysis passes), and `irdump` (`arcc --dump-ir`).
- Passes: collect declarations, resolve kind chains, build the program-wide
  property table (one type per property, type-clash diagnostic, provisional
  attribute-vs-slot storage), then resolve bodies (name resolution, the
  `is`-test disambiguation, the boolean-condition check, declare-before-change,
  and handler event and operand validation).
- Done-test green: the world-model IR for both example games is correct. The
  CLI parses and checks by default.

### B3: the z5 backend MVP

- `arcturus/` gains `zstring` (the ZSCII / Z-string encoder), `storyfile` (the
  header and region assembler, with checksum and length), and `codegen` (lower
  the world model to a complete z5 image). `arcc -o game.z5` now writes a story
  file. The construct-to-opcode mapping is documented in
  docs/04-codegen-mapping.md.
- The smallest program (a `game` block, an `on start` with `say` lines, and one
  room) compiles to a valid z5 that prints the banner and the start text, then
  quits. The banner is emitted by the compiler as a provisional stand-in; it
  becomes Cosmos's job at B4, and the compiler still hardcodes nothing about
  the library.
- Done-test green: the generated story file runs on Frotz (verified with
  `dfrotz`; the test skips cleanly where no interpreter is present).

### Distribution and housekeeping

- The compiler is developed as a modular package but shipped as a single
  standalone `arcc` script, built by `tools/amalgamate.py`, which embeds each
  module verbatim behind an in-memory loader. `tests/test_standalone.py` runs
  the generated script with no package on `sys.path` to prevent drift.
- Every Python source file carries a credit header. The `arcc` CLI prints an
  Inform-style banner and copyright. The compiler hardcodes nothing about the
  Cosmos library, including its version (the library will declare its own, used
  only for the in-game banner).
- File-extension conventions fixed: `.storyarc` (story), `.prelude` (Cosmos
  library file), `.granule` (extension). The specs were updated to match: the
  syntax reference (docs/01) now documents all three extensions, and the
  Cosmos/parser spec (docs/02) refers to library files as `.prelude` and
  extensions as `.granule`.

### Documentation policy

When a change affects anything the public-facing documentation describes, the
docs are updated in the same step. New conventions are recorded here as they
are introduced.

## In progress: B4 — Cosmos compiled by the compiler

The parser, turn loop, and standard verbs, written in Arcturus and compiled
together with the game. Done-test: both example games playable start to finish
on Frotz. Decisions settled: parser/scope/dispatch/loop/verbs live in Arcturus,
with the compiler providing only low-level intrinsics; the parser keeps a
language seam so a language pack can override grammar logic; the verb set for
B4 is what the two games exercise (the full set rounds out in B6).

Subgoals (each with its own done-test; the story file is handed off to run on
Frotz at each runnable step):

- [x] B4.1 - routines, locals, stack, CALL (the instruction assembler)
- [x] B4.2 - expressions, control flow, and the statement set
- [x] B4.3 - the object table (attributes, properties, tree, short names)
- [x] B4.4 - the dictionary and input tokenizing
- B4.5 - Cosmos in Arcturus (staged):
  - [x] B4.5a - compile all handlers and blocks to routines
  - [ ] B4.5b - dispatch (Arcturus dispatcher + compiler-wired handlers)
  - [ ] B4.5c - scope and light
  - [ ] B4.5d - the parser
  - [ ] B4.5e - turn loop + standard verbs + banner
- [ ] B4.6 - integration, DCE-friendly structure, docs

B4.5 architecture (settled): the compiler provides reserved intrinsic built-ins
that lower to opcodes (read_line, peek/poke, parse-buffer access); dispatch is
model B (the compiler wires per-object/kind handler routines and Cosmos's
Arcturus dispatcher walks the chain, handlers returning 1 = handled / 0 =
continue); arcc auto-includes the bundled Cosmos unless an author forks a file.

## Next: B5

The size pass: dead-code elimination, the arcabbr abbreviation pipeline, and
codegen tightening. Target: a representative game at or (per the project bar)
under its PunyInform-equivalent size.
